# Tools & Scripts

I love scripting in Python and have made a few useful tools for myself
and my fellow animators. Most of them you can find on Github.

### My favorites:
[ConMan](/tools/ConMan) -- A constraint manager for Maya to ease
the pain of switching weights among multiple targets. It enables animation
and snap-free switching. An object list allows the user to select the
constrained object.  

[Butter](/tools/Butter) -- A Butterworth filter for
Maya animation curves. Cleaning noisy mocap data? Need to
maintain overall action while removing the jitters?  Want this
to all work interactively? This filter might be just for you!  

### Experiments:
[Pyrust]( {{ site.github.owner_url }}/BlenderRust) --
Integrates a Rust binary into Blender through an add-on.
This project was to try building and bundling a native
library with Python through setuptools and the ctypes
ffi interface.

[Blenderpython]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/blenderpython/tree/ita_tools) --
A project to collect and maintain old or forgotten Blender add-ons
(originally started by [meta-androcto](https://github.com/meta-androcto/)).
This repo also contains some of my own add-ons.
